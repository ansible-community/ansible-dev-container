# community-ansible-dev-tools

A container image for Ansible Development Tools (ADT).

The ADT python package provides an easy way to install and discover the best tools available to create and test ansible content.
More details on ADT can be found in <https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/dev-tools/>.

This image is built on top of [Fedora 39 minimal](quay.io/fedora/fedora-minimal:39) and has container-in-container support with [`podman`](https://podman.io/docs).

## Installation

```bash
podman pull ghcr.io/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools:latest
```

## Usage

### Using this as a VS code Dev Container

Dev Containers provide you with a containerized development environment in VS code. Details on what they are and how to use them can be found in [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

This image can be used as an image for a Dev Container where you build and consume Ansible content.

This repository comes with a sample [`.devcontainer directory`](https://github.com/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools-container/tree/main/.devcontainer) with 2 subdirectories - `podman` and `docker` each having it's own
`devcontainer.json` file.

You can simply copy over the `.devcontainer` directory to your Ansible project and start using it!

### Using this with Github Codespaces

To use this image with [Github Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview), copy the [`devcontainer.json`](https://github.com/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools-container/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) in this repo to your project and push to Github.

**Note:** If you are planning to start writing a new Ansible playbook project or collection, use [Ansible Creator](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/creator) to scaffold it for you and your project/collection will already have all the `.devcontainer` files ready.

### Using this image as an EE

This image can also be used as an Ansible Execution Environment (EE). If you're not familiar with what an EE is, checkout the documentation in [Getting started with EE](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started_ee/index.html). It is shipped with the following Ansible collections:

- ansible.netcommon
- ansible.posix
- ansible.scm
- ansible.utils

You can also create a new EE based on this with more Ansible collections (or Python/System packages) of your choice by using Ansible Builder. Read this [documentation](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/builder/en/latest/) to know about ansible-builder.

The below example shows how to make a custom EE that adds the `amazon.aws` and `cisco.nxos` collections as well as the `ansible-pylibssh` python package to this image.

1. Create an `execution-environment.yml` file with the following content.

    ```yaml
    ---
    version: 3

    images:
      base_image: ghcr.io/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools-container:latest

    dependencies:
      galaxy: requirements.yml
      python: requirements.txt
    ```

2. Populate `requirements.txt` and `requirements.yml` with the respective contents.

    requirements.txt

    ```bash
    ansible-pylibssh==1.1.0
    ```

    requirements.yml

    ```yaml
    ---
    collections:
    - name: amazon.aws
    - name: cisco.nxos
    ```

3. Use `ansible-builder` to create the new EE.

    ```bash
    ansible-builder build -t custom-ee:latest --prune-images -v3
    ```

Once this image is built, you can use [`ansible-navigator`](https://ansible.readthedocs.io/projects/navigator/) to reference this image and run your playbooks!

### Layering ADT and container-in-container support on a custom image

In order to add the Ansible Devtools package and the container-in-container support with podman using a custom EE or another container image, you can use to the [final
Containerfile](https://github.com/ansible/community-ansible-dev-tools-container/blob/main/final/Containerfile) from this repository. Update the `FROM` instruction to point to
your preferred image and build it using `podman` or `docker`.

**Note:** The container-in-container support is added with the help of the [podman image](https://github.com/containers/image_build/tree/main/podman) definition. For more information, read [How to use Podman inside of a container](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/podman-inside-container).
